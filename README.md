What is it?
This queueing system is a created using Laravel as its framework for both frontend and backend. It
is created for the sole usage of the Office of Business and Management of Eastern Visayas State
University, Ormoc City. It also serves as one of the very first projects I created and is what i used
to be introduced to using Laravel and all of its different features.

Langagues used are php and javascript mainly, and it was built using html, css, laravel, jquery, apache,
mysql, and others, and especially with the not so small aid of my greatest supporter, ChatGPT >_<.
